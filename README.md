## Tech Stack

This app using BLoC State Management with Clean Architecture paradigm. Using `http` for http client.
The developer's not forget to add app interceptor to track the http request with Alice. Alice is
similar with Chucker (on Native Android).

This app also uses Hive as a NoSQL Local Database. The developer's not lazy to use SQLite as a
local database, but he's thinking about simplicity.
